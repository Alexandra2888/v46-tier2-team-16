## Project Description

Zest is a web app that lets users find and sort recipes. It uses the Tasty API. By default users can see browse an entire page of recipes. Users can search for recipes by their name (such as mac and cheese) and category (such as vegetarian, or pasta). Moreover, the user can filter recipes by categories.

## Major Functions and Features

1. **Browse recipes:** The landing page features a list of recipe cards, which contain information about ingredients, cooking times and step-by-step directions. Each of the recipes contains a picture of the dish and a nutritional chart. The recipes displayed are fetched using the Tasty API.

2. **Find recipes:** By interacting with the search bar, the user can look for recipes entering a dish name or a category description (such as "under 30 minutes"). The results show up on the main page when the user use the search bar.

2. **Sort recipes:** The user can sort the recipes by cooking time, nutritional value and alphabetically.
